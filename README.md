🌍 Predicting First Year Modeled Energy Savings ($ Estimate) 🔋💰

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate the First Year Modeled Energy Savings ($ Estimate) for residential energy efficiency projects. By analyzing various factors such as project costs, retrofitting measures, and customer characteristics, this model will provide insights into optimizing energy efficiency programs and resource allocation for maximum impact.

🎯 Use Case

The predictive model will assist energy program managers and policymakers in evaluating and enhancing energy efficiency initiatives. The insights derived from the model will help:

📊 Improve subsidy designs by identifying key factors influencing energy savings.

💡 Optimize resource allocation to maximize returns on investment.

🏡 Support households in achieving cost-effective energy efficiency improvements.

🔎 Assumptions

The target variable, First Year Modeled Energy Savings ($ Estimate), is estimated based on predicted post-retrofit energy savings in dollars.

Energy prices are assumed to remain constant across projects due to the absence of dynamic energy pricing information in the dataset.

The analysis simplifies the relationship between energy consumption savings and dollar savings to ensure consistency in model predictions.
